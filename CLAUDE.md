## Architecture

### Core Framework Stack
- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI framework for iOS/macOS
- **SwiftData**: Apple's modern data persistence framework
- **CloudKit**: Cloud synchronization (configured for development)
- **XCTest**: Testing framework for unit and UI tests

### Data Model (Current)
- **Item.swift**: Basic SwiftData model with timestamp (placeholder for park data)
- **ModelContainer**: Configured for persistent storage (not in-memory)
- **Schema**: Currently includes only Item model

### UI Architecture
- **App Entry Point**: `FogFernApp.swift` - Sets up ModelContainer and WindowGroup
- **Main View**: `ContentView.swift` - NavigationSplitView with list/detail layout
- **iPhone-Focused**: Optimized for iPhone for MVP (no iPad/macOS support)
- **Preview Support**: SwiftUI previews with in-memory data for development

### Key Capabilities
- **CloudKit Integration**: Configured for cloud data sync
- **iPhone Only**: MVP focused on iPhone platform
- **App Sandbox**: Enabled for security
- **Background Modes**: Remote notifications supported
- **Previews**: SwiftUI preview system for rapid development

## Development Workflow

### Building & Running
```bash
# Open in Xcode
open FogFern.xcodeproj

# Build for iOS Simulator (iPhone)
xcodebuild -project FogFern.xcodeproj -scheme FogFern -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' build

# Build for iPhone Device
xcodebuild -project FogFern.xcodeproj -scheme FogFern -destination 'platform=iOS,name=Any iOS Device' build
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
xcodebuild test -project FogFern.xcodeproj -scheme FogFern -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro'

# Run UI tests
xcodebuild test -project FogFern.xcodeproj -scheme FogFern -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' -only-testing:FogFernUITests
```

### Code Organization Patterns
- **SwiftUI Views**: Follow declarative UI patterns with `@State`, `@Environment`, `@Query`
- **Data Access**: Use `@Environment(\.modelContext)` for SwiftData operations
- **iPhone-Only**: No platform-specific code needed for MVP
- **Asset Management**: All visual assets in `Assets.xcassets` with proper scaling

- CloudKit entitlements configuration
- SwiftUI app structure with NavigationSplitView
- Testing targets (unit and UI tests)
- App icon assets (multiple sizes for all platforms)

### ðŸ”„ In Progress / Next Steps
- Replace placeholder Item model with Park data models
- Implement park discovery and listing features
- Add visit logging and check-in functionality
- Create journaling and history views
- Build goal tracking and badge systems

## Key Technical Considerations

### SwiftData Models
- Current: Basic `Item` with timestamp
- Needed: `Park`, `Visit`, `Goal`, `Badge` models
- Use `@Model` macro for SwiftData integration
- Consider relationships between models

### CloudKit Sync
- Development environment configured
- App Groups enabled for data sharing
- Consider offline-first approach with sync

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Uses `SDKROOT = auto` for universal builds
- Conditional UI elements for iOS vs macOS
- Shared codebase with platform-specific adaptations

### Location Services (Future)
- Will need location permissions for park proximity
- Consider background location for automatic check-ins
- Privacy-focused implementation required

## Fundamental Coding Principles

### Extensibility & Future-Proofing
**City-Agnostic Design**: While targeting San Francisco initially, the architecture must support easy expansion to other cities:
- Abstract city-specific data (park lists, boundaries, local regulations) into configurable data sources
- Use dependency injection for location-specific services (weather APIs, transit data, local event feeds)
- Design data models to support multiple cities without breaking changes
- Consider city as a first-class entity in the data model from the start

### Code Organization & Composability
**Modular Architecture**: Break functionality into focused, composable modules:
- **Models/**: SwiftData models (`Park`, `Visit`, `Goal`, `Badge`, `City`) in separate files
- **Views/**: SwiftUI views organized by feature area (Discovery, Logging, Profile, etc.)
- **Services/**: Business logic services (`LocationService`, `GoalTrackingService`, `SyncService`)
- **Utilities/**: Reusable components (`DateFormatters`, `LocationHelpers`, `ValidationHelpers`)
- **Extensions/**: Framework extensions grouped by type

**Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file, class, and function should have one clear purpose:
- Avoid monolithic view controllers or service classes
- Extract complex logic into dedicated utility functions
- Keep SwiftUI views focused on presentation, delegate business logic to services
- Use computed properties and small, focused methods

### Testing Strategy
**Test-Driven Development**: Write tests alongside code, not as an afterthought:
- Unit tests for all business logic, models, and utility functions
- SwiftUI view tests using accessibility identifiers and test predicates
- Integration tests for SwiftData operations and CloudKit sync
- UI tests for critical user flows (park discovery, check-ins, goal completion)
- Mock external dependencies (location services, network calls) for reliable testing

### Clean Architecture Patterns
**Separation of Concerns**:
- **Data Layer**: SwiftData models, repositories, and persistence logic
- **Domain Layer**: Business entities, use cases, and core application logic
- **Presentation Layer**: SwiftUI views, view models, and UI state management
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External services, APIs, and framework integrations

**Dependency Direction**: Dependencies should flow inward toward the domain:
- Views depend on view models, not directly on services
- Services depend on protocols, not concrete implementations
- Use Swift protocols for testability and flexibility

### Data Architecture Best Practices
**Robust Data Modeling**:
- Use value types (structs) for immutable data where appropriate
- Implement proper validation at model boundaries
- Design for offline-first functionality with sync capabilities
- Use consistent naming conventions across all data models
- Plan for data migration strategies from the beginning

**State Management**:
- Use `@State` for local view state, `@Environment` for shared app state
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Consider using `@Observable` classes for complex shared state
- Avoid massive view state objects; break into focused pieces

### Performance & Scalability Considerations
**Efficient Data Operations**:
- Use SwiftData queries with proper predicates and sorting
- Implement pagination for large datasets (park lists, visit history)
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately
- Consider memory usage when loading images and media

**SwiftUI Performance**:
- Use `@ViewBuilder` properly to avoid unnecessary view updates  
- Implement efficient list rendering with proper identifiers
- Optimize image loading and caching for park photos
- Profile performance regularly, especially on older devices

### Code Quality Standards
**Maintainability**:
- Use descriptive naming for all functions, variables, and types
- Add inline documentation for complex business logic
- Follow Swift API design guidelines consistently
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful error types
- Use Swift's type system to prevent common bugs (optionals, enums, etc.)

**Code Review Principles**:
- Every feature should be reviewable by focusing on single concerns
- Use meaningful commit messages that explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep pull requests focused and reasonably sized
- Document any non-obvious architectural decisions

## Common Development Commands
